# Urban-Sound-Classification
##### Five convolutional neural networks were created to classify different urban sounds. The dataset of sounds used can be found here: https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/. The models were tested against three different feature sets to find an optimal model for each of the feature sets.

This work was completed as part of a group project undertaken in module CMT307 Applied Machine Learning at Cardiff University.
